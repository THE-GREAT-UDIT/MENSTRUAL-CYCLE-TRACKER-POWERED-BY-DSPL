# MENSTRUAL-CYCLE-TRACKER-POWERED-BY-DSPL
We are thrilled to announce the release of the Menstruation Cycle Tracker (MCT) repository by DSPL (Data Software and Programming Language) led by Mr. Udit Jain.
This project is a collaborative effort involving the DSPL department, the Graphics Design team led by Shraddha , and the talented members from the Frontend and Backend departments. MCT is a special gift for Women's Day, utilizing AI and machine learning algorithms to help individuals track their menstrual cycles effectively. With this tracker, users can monitor their period dates, track cycle lengths, record symptoms, and gain valuable insights into their overall period health.

We would like to express our gratitude to the entire team for their dedication and hard work in bringing this project to life. The Graphics Design team has created stunning visuals, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The Frontend and Backend teams have implemented robust functionality and integrated powerful algorithms to provide accurate predictions and personalized insights.

We are excited to share this open-source project with the GitHub community, and we hope it proves to be a valuable resource for individuals seeking to track and manage their menstrual cycles. We welcome your contributions, feedback, and suggestions to further enhance the MCT project.

Happy coding and a special Women's Day to all!
